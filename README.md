# Honey-Do List

Honey-Do List is an application that allows the user to create a to-do list through the power of JavaScript.

1. The user has the ability to add items and have them displayed on a list (either by pressing the '+' sign or pressing 'enter'
2. If the user finishes a task, they can mark the task as 'complete' by clicking/tapping one on the list item to put a line-through
3. If the user wants to remove an item from the list, the user can double-click the list item to remove it completely from the list
